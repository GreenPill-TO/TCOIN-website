            <h2>What is Toronto Coin?</h2>
            <p>Toronto Coin, or T-Coin, is a groundbreaking local currency initiative designed to strengthen Toronto's economy, enhance community engagement, and promote sustainable practices. T-Coin is a modern, blockchain-based currency that combines the benefits of digital and physical money to keep value circulating within our local community. By using T-Coin, you're not just making a transaction—you're supporting local businesses, contributing to local charities, and participating in a more equitable and sustainable economic system.</p>
            <p>This is a temporary website until we find the time to build a proper one.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>How Does T-Coin Work?</h2>
            <p><strong>Supporting local businesses, fostering community engagement, and building a sustainable Toronto economy.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Digital Wallets and Blockchain:</strong> T-Coin operates on a secure blockchain ledger, ensuring transparency and security for all transactions. Users manage their T-Coins through a user-friendly digital wallet app, making payments as simple as a tap on your smartphone.</p>
            <p><strong>Physical tBills:</strong> For those who prefer physical currency, T-Coin also offers tBills—plastic bills embedded with RFID technology. These tBills are available in various denominations and can be used just like cash, with the added benefit of easy verification through the T-Coin app.</p>
            <p><strong>Community and Charity:</strong> Each time you purchase T-Coins, 3% of your transaction is directly donated to a local charity of your choice. This makes every transaction not just a personal benefit but a contribution to the community.</p>
            <p><strong>QR-based payments:</strong> Paying someone is easy. Panhandlers will have a personal QR code you can scan and send any amount to. Waitresses will have a QR code to which you select a percentage as a tip. Stores can easily create a QR code with a specific amount for you to scan and pay.</p>
            <p><strong>Real Price Stability, Value Pegged to TTC:</strong> T-Coin's value is pegged to the cost of a full fare on the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC), ensuring stability and practical value in everyday transactions. Currently priced at $3.30, but when Metrolinx increases the price to $3.40 or $3.50 (?) then the value of your T-Coin will also increase. This provides price stability better than the Canadian Dollar, and ensures it remains relevant and good for practical use in everyday transactions.</p>
            <p><strong>3% Transaction Fees:</strong> You already pay 3% to credit cards like Visa and Mastercard. Well, the store pays the 3% and keep 97%. T-Coin will also charge the same 3% fee from stores, but in this case the money goes directly to a local charity instead of an anonymous financial behemoth. And it's a charity of your own choice. Just set it up once in the T-Coin app and then 3% will be routed to them for every transaction you make.</p>
            <p><strong>Demurrage:</strong> "Coins are round because they should roll." Velocity of money is good for society. Our way of contributing is by introducing a 1% "demurrage" per month, which is another name for "negative interest rate". At the end of each month you'll see the amount of T-Coin in your wallet reduced by 1%. This acts as an inventive for you to spend your T-Coin, to the benefit of your local community, rather than hoarding them.</p>

                <li><strong>Fundraising for Schools:</strong> Schools can organize fundraising events where donations are made in T-Coins, ensuring that the contributions stay within the community and support local education.</li>

                <li><strong>Shopping at Local Stores:</strong> Use T-Coins to pay for goods and services at participating local businesses. Instead of transaction fees going to big corporations like Visa and Mastercard, 3% of your purchase value is donated to local charities, amplifying the positive impact of your shopping.</li>

            <h2>Why Use T-Coin?</h2>
            <p><strong>Support Local Businesses:</strong> T-Coin is designed to keep money circulating within Toronto, helping local businesses thrive in the face of competition from large corporations and online retailers.</p>

            <p><strong>Financial Inclusion:</strong> T-Coin offers an accessible alternative to traditional financial systems, especially for those who may be underserved by conventional banking.</p>
