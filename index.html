            <h2>What is Toronto Coin?</h2>
            <p>Toronto Coin, or T-Coin, is a groundbreaking local currency initiative designed to strengthen Toronto's economy, enhance community engagement, and promote sustainable practices. T-Coin is a modern, blockchain-based currency that combines the benefits of digital and physical money to keep value circulating within our local community. By using T-Coin, you're not just making a transaction—you're supporting local businesses, contributing to local charities, and participating in a more equitable and sustainable economic system.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>How Does T-Coin Work?</h2>
            <p><strong>Digital Wallets and Blockchain:</strong> T-Coin operates on a secure blockchain ledger, ensuring transparency and security for all transactions. Users manage their T-Coins through a user-friendly digital wallet app, making payments as simple as a tap on your smartphone.</p>
            <p><strong>Physical tBills:</strong> For those who prefer physical currency, T-Coin also offers tBills—plastic bills embedded with RFID technology. These tBills are available in various denominations and can be used just like cash, with the added benefit of easy verification through the T-Coin app.</p>
            <p><strong>Community and Charity:</strong> Each time you purchase T-Coins, 3% of your transaction is directly donated to a local charity of your choice. This makes every transaction not just a personal benefit but a contribution to the community.</p>
            <p><strong>Price Stability:</strong> T-Coin's value is pegged to the cost of a full fare on the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC), ensuring stability and practical value in everyday transactions.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Broad Potential for Use Cases</h2>
            <p>T-Coin's versatility allows it to be used in a wide range of scenarios, making it an integral part of Toronto's local economy:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fundraising for Schools:</strong> Schools can organize fundraising events where donations are made in T-Coins, ensuring that the contributions stay within the community and support local education.</li>
                <li><strong>Donations to Local Charities or Panhandlers:</strong> Easily donate to your favorite local charity or even help someone in need directly with T-Coins, knowing that your donation is secure, trackable, and beneficial to the community.

                <li><strong>Shopping at Local Stores:</strong> Use T-Coins to pay for goods and services at participating local businesses. Instead of transaction fees going to big corporations like Visa and Mastercard, 3% of your purchase value is donated to local charities, amplifying the positive impact of your shopping.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <p><strong>Financial Inclusion:</strong> T-Coin offers an accessible alternative to traditional financial systems, especially for those who may be underserved by conventional banking.</p>
            <p><strong>Strengthen the Community:</strong> By using T-Coin, you’re helping to build a more resilient and connected Toronto, where every transaction benefits your neighbors and local causes.</p>
